# voice-harmonizer

Records audio and generates the harmony based on the user-desired harmony (e.g. minor third, perfect fourth, etc.).

Uses FFT analysis to determine the frequency of the input audio notes and calculates the corresponding harmonic frequencies. A separate harmony WAV file is then generated.
